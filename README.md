As this was my first real website code attempt, the project was based on [this](http://thesiteslinger.com/blog/tutorial-how-to-code-your-psd-into-a-html-css-layout/) online tutorial.
The template itself has some sort of minimalist look and is really simple, with few elements and not so much color. I tried to make it better by changing some of the original phrases and adding some more text to make it feel more inspiring and natural. At the same time, I did not want to break the personality of the website.  
##### With this project, I learned to...   
– Use a texture as the background of the footer section.  
– Use an image with three icons to add an original icon before each navigation menu item.  
– Substitute outdated technology regarding a font used and almost [100 unwanted lines of CSS](https://github.com/carolinaknoll/insight/blob/0a16759e47c60e4346103ea4d759e8f53cac23b7/css/style.css) code (lines 187 to 278) to FontAwesome icons, at the footer section.
